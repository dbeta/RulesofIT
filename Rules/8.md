# 8 IT is a force multiplier

Rule 7 is very important, but also remember that IT, at its core, a force multiplier. Computers have always existed to allow humans to be more productive. The reason security is important is because nothing kills productivity quite as much as ransomware.

Remember that your goal should be to make sure other employees are as productive as possible. Sometimes that goal is longer term than you might realize. In our field, you might look at tickets as a production waster, but on a long view, you see that they help with change tracking, documentation, team work, tracking goals, and make sure things don't fall through the cracks.


## Expodential thinking
> It’s easy to predict where you’ll end up after 30 linear steps (30 meters away). But if I asked you to predict where you’ll be in 30 exponential steps — where an exponential is a simple doubling... 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and so on — it gets harder.
