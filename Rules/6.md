# Good, Cheap, Fast. Pick 1.

Good takes time, and usually resources. There's no way around it. If you are doing the job right, not only are you doing the job, but you are also noting everything you did. This adds up. Don't sell your time short. And things cost money. Sometimes you can get away with free tools or random PowerShell scripts from blogs, but sometimes you need to buy a tool, and trying to avoid it is going to cause you headaches. Wrench makes a poor substitute for a wrench.
