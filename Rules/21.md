# 21 Be kind

Life is not a competition. Ask your peers how they are doing, invest in relationships. Share knowledge without expecting anything in return.

## Sub Rules

### 21.1 Users are people too

We all have bad days. We all have a lot on our plate. Remember that users have the same stuff going on, but when their computers fail them, they don't understand why. They may be frustrated, annoyed, and confused by the time they talk to you. Try to be patient and give them the benefit of the doubt.
