# 11 Don't forget to document

Documenting your work has oh so many benefits. At first it may seem like it is a waste of time. Slowing you down when you have precious little time to spare. Eventually you will look back and wonder what the heck you were doing. Whether it is a firewall config, or a line of code, a little documentation will go a long way.

### 11.1 Any documentation is better than no documentation

Although it can be frustrating to have half the picture, that's still more useful than no picture. Do yourself a favor and make notes, store them somewhere you or others can find them. They don't have to be good, but the need to exist.

### 11.2 All documentation lies

People write documentation based on how they think the system works, not on how it actually works. Trust but verify documented information.
