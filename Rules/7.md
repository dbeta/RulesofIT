# 7 Security is important

Very often when setting up or modifying systems, security is skipped. Security isn't always free. It isn't always easy. It doesn't always directly increase production. All of that is true, but it's hard to overstate the inconvenience of a security breach.

There is no perfect solution. You will never be "Done" securing your systems. Every change, addition, or removal should include a thought for security.

Sometimes you have to make the hard choices and choose functionality over security, but those should be known. Preferably choices in writing, signed off by someone.

It's also important to note that security is always second. Without a business operation to protect, there's nothing to secure. And the best security is simple and low-friction for the end user, which is the security that will actually be used.
